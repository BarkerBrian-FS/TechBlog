Coding has been more of an adventure than I ever thought it would be.  When I decided to start at Full Sail I wanted to try something new that I never experienced before.  After about six months of research I decided to try web development and see where it took me.  When school began it was literally my first time coding or doing anything in any type of development environment I barely knew how to use console commands.  Fast forward to now I still struggle with things but I can eventually figure it out and make things work.  I can honestly say that I am 100% happy with my choice to learn coding.  I get immense joy from the problem solving that takes place and I can't wait to see what else I can learn and where it will take me.
