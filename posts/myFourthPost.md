When I started school I learned that JS is one of my biggest struggles when it comes to coding.  Right now it is just a lot to remember and its hard to apply the logic.  Going from nothing and following steps to an actual app or site is difficult for me.  Since I am struggling to remember and apply the concepts I decided to purchase a Js course through Udemy.  So far it has been really helpful, it starts with the very basics and works its way up to the harder concepts.  It has multiple projects to work on every few sections like a number guessing project and them some full applications.  I am hoping that by building these projects I will become more proficient and it will get me in the mindset to code.
