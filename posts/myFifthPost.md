This week we had to create a mobile app using react native.  This was definitely a fun yet frustrating time for me.  Not only have I not completely figured out the hosting but now I am learning to us a mobile development tool.  I still enjoyed my time using it learning something new is always fun.  The challenge is what lets us know that it is worth it.  I hope that with more practice I will be able to master react native and maybe one day be able to completely code my own app.  Also I might be seeing you in the future in this same class.
