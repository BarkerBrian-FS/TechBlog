Hugo is a static site generator.  When I had to do the assignment this was my first experience with a static site generator.  The idea of it sounds completely amazing.  It gives you the ability to code and deploy sites in the blink of an eye.  I can't think of anybody who is in web development that wouldn't enjoy something like that.  So far I have had some issues with hugo mainly just the deployment part.  Im hoping that I can become proficient and be able to take of all the advantages it has to offer.
