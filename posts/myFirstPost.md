First I would like to discuss my recent experience with Next.js.  Next.js is a static generator using React.  I thought since they were connected that I would be reasonably easy to catch on and finish my assignment.  Oh man was I wrong!  It was problem after problem.  The two share similar things like the use of components and routing but at the same time its like a whole new system to learn.  Honestly I enjoyed learning how to use it but at the same time it has been causing me an immense amount of stress.
